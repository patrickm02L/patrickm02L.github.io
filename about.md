Hello,

I’ve worked in government, nonprofit, arts, and start-ups and have a breadth of understanding about how to navigate the different sectors of city building.

I have a Master’s degree in Urban Planning and Master’s in Higher Education. I jump back and forth between the two coming up with city hacks - ways to deconstruct the city and make it better - and integrate education and documentation of how I did it.

In my own practice, I want to continue to make urban planning accessible to the masses.

Check out my social media channels to see how I organize and distribute projects and campaigns. Fair warning, you might love it!

The name patrickm02L is my internet handle. The “patrick m” part is my name Patrick McDonnell and the “02L” is a nod to my military history. 02L is the Army designator for saxophone player. I joined right out of high school, spent four years on active duty, and four years in the National Guard playing music and serving our country.

Have a great day!
