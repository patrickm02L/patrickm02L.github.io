### JULY 2014
#### 25 Friday

Watched: GitHub Use Cases, Workflows & Desktop Apps http://youtu.be/l40x1EshOBE

Started my own GitHub pages page on Github web. 

Downloaded GitHub App for Mac and Atom Text Editor.

Found a simple website example to copy: http://cathydeng.github.io/ via @cathydeng.


#### 26 Saturday

Followed along with the GitHub Use Cases vid and did as it did. 

Re-typed code that I wanted from Cathy's site on my site into Atom text editor to get a sense of how to write code. 

Committed changes through desktop client. 

After 2hrs, I had simple site that could be reviewed, and was comfortable with the GitHub tools and workflow.

#### 27 Sunday

Tweeted at Lou Huang https://github.com/louh and asked for help.

He tweeted back and agreed to help for 30min on a Sunday afternoon. 

Jumped on a Google Hangout. Did a line-by-line review and comparison of my website to Cathy's.

#### 28 Monday

Fine tuning here and there. Continuing research about what the lines I copied mean, and how to improve them.
