Log of events

### JULY
#### 25 Friday

Watched: GitHub Use Cases, Workflows & Desktop Apps http://youtu.be/l40x1EshOBE

Started my own github pages page. 

Found a simple website example to copy: http://cathydeng.github.io/  via @cathydeng.
Copy and pasted code that I wanted on my site into. 

#### 26 Saturday

Followed along with the GitHub Use Cases vid and did as it did. 

Created a simple site that could be reviewed. 

#### 27 Sunday

Tweeted at Lou Huang https://github.com/louh and asked for help.
He tweeted back and agreed to help for 30min on a Sunday afternoon. 

Jumped on a Google Hangout and we did a line-by-line review and comparison of my website to Cathy's.

#### 28 Monday
Fine tuning here and there. Researching more about what the lines I copied mean and how to improve them.
