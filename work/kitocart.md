The Kit-O-Cart was developed and designed by Artist Chat Travieso as part of the South Elm Projects.

My main responsibility was to scope the project, manage the budget, procure the trailer and build materials, coordinate a paid work program with boys and girls in the Somali refugee community, and help with prototyping.
