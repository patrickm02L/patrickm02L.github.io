Hopscotch, a project by artist Agustina Woodgate was created as part of the South Elm Projects.

Agustina painted a giant hopscotch on the sidewalk around the South End neighborhood continuing a hopscotch she started in Buenos Aires.
My role was to get the proper permits from the city, work with the business owners to get permission for the hopscotch, coordinate paid local student volunteers, scout the locations, and help with the painting.
