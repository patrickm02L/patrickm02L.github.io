The Dallas Visual Timeline breaks the city down into four main urban design categories: parks, city growth, buildings, and transportation. It starts at the beginning of Dallas's history in the early 1840s and goes to present day.

The timeline was created in conjunction with the opening of Dallas's Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. It was open to the public for viewing and served as a feedback board for what urban design citizens would live to see in the city.
