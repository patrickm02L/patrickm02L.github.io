The Ice Stage was a pop-up that debuted on PARK(ing) Day Dallas 2012. Using found plywood, scrap wood and left-over paint, we created an enclosed space with a podium for people to say nice things about each other or write them on the ground with sidewalk chalk. If folks said nice things into the megaphone we gave them an ice cream bars.

N(ice) Cream Stage. Get it?
