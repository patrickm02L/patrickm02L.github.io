Miles was a piece I created for Art Conspiracy 8 in Dallas. The annual event invites artists from around the community to donate their art to raise money for a local charity.

It was a hand-drawn charcoal piece that I created on matte board and pasted to wood. The entire process took 12hrs.

The subject matter, Miles Davis, is one of my musical heroes. I grew up listening to Jazz and idolizing Miles for his penchant for breaking the rules and re-defining an era. I only listened to jazz while making the piece.
