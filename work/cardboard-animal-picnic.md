The Cardboard Animal Picnic was an event to promote play in an underutilized public space - Main Street Garden, in Downtown Dallas. Whereas, most events cost money, and involve permitting through the city, this event was about going out to the park and using it without having to go through formal channels.

It was organized in conjunction with GOOD magazine inaugural Neighborday celebration, aimed at getting people to meet their neighbors.
