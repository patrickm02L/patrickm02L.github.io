Balançoire, which is French for 'swing' was a project that I created as part of the Paris Innovation Fellowship. The idea was to turn Paris into a playground by creating a tactical urbanism intervention.

I wanted to continue my work with swings and play in the city. Instead of build a giant structure, I decided take a DIY mindset by using the city's infrastructure as the frame to hang a swing seat.

The project happened over 2-weeks, was deployed three times legally, and was also my first venture into vlogging. I documented everyday of #ParisFellows fellowship deploying 1-minute videos daily, made micro videos of the swing in action to spread the word on social media, and created a video for the final presentation.

Play is SO important!
