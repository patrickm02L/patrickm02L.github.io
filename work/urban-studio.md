Urban Studio was a class I taught for The Rhythm of Urban Life 5-week Summer Camp at the Oak Cliff Cultural Center.

I taught students ages 6-14 Urban Design principles by incorporating play, design, and building. Activities included: drawing street sections, creating construction paper models of Klyde Warren Park, and building 'City Monsters' that would help solve problems in the urban environment.

At the end of the second week in of the Rhythm of Urban Life summer camp, the class (ages 6-14) went on a field trip to Dallas's newest public space Klyde Warren Park. They observed, played music, danced, ate and played in the water.
