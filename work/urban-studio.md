Urban Studio was a class I taught for The Rhythm of Urban Life 5-week Summer Camp at the Oak Cliff Cultural Center.

I taught students ages 6-14 Urban Design principles by incorporating play, design, and building. Activities included: drawing street sections, creating construction paper models of Klyde Warren Park, and building 'City Monsters' that would help solve problems in the urban environment.
