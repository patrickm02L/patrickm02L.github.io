Living Plaza, was a monthly placemaking event that promoted the activation of Dallas's City Hall Plaza as an example of how to how underutilized spaces could be easily activated with the use of tables and chair, music, and foodtrucks.

It was also an exercise in Special Events permitting - there was an event every month for 6 months that involved coordinating with the city, with musicians, artists, security, the media, and city officials.

This was my first major project in the public spaces / placemaking arena. This is where I cut my teeth!
