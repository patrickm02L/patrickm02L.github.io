The 'Yard' short for backyard was created by artists the Greensboro Permaculture Guild and John Futrell. It was the first in the South Elm Projects series possibly the most complex.

The land where the 'yard' was created was shared by three different owners. My role was to bring them together, facilitated design conversations for the landscaping, purchase materials, and get creative with the budget. It truly embodied the spirit of the South Elm Projects and using art to connect community.
