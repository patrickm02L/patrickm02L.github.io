Chalk and October equals Chalktober!

There is an ordinance prohibits 'altering' the pavement in any way. The event was all about showing how innocuous sidewalk chalk is in the urban environment.

The event came about after being reprimanded for writing several messages of joy with sidewalk chalk at Pegasus Plaza in Downtown Dallas. A facebook event was posted and several chalk stations were set up around downtown, and we encourage other to come out and chalk with us for an afternoon.

Every Tactical Urbanist has their chalk phase!
