The Bookworm Mini Parklet asked the question does a parklet have to be expensive?

This prototype cost $54 took 10hrs to make. The cardboard, gator board, and foam core was scrap taken from a modeling shop and fastened together with threaded rods, screws, and glue. The top section for seating was made out of used cardboard tubes and rope.

April coincided with book month in Dallas, so we incorporated slots for books to integrated into the design. The Bookworm mini parklet was debuted at a Street Festival called Taco Fest in the Deep Ellum neighborhood in Downtown Dallas.
